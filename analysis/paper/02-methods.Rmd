## Data imputation

Raw data contained COX measurements for 247 brain regions and 14 rats. Seven animals were from control and 7 from treatment groups, respectively. For 69 brain regions, the data were complete. The rest of brain regions were missing measurements for 1 or more animals. We decided to use multiple imputation of the missing data to make the best unbiased use of the available data. The imputations were modeled as a joint multivariate normal distribution. This model was applied to brain regions with 2 or fewer missing cases in each experimental condition. There were 190 such brain regions. The rest of the data were discarded. 10 multiply imputed datasets were generated by R-package *mice* [@R-mice]. The algorithm was given 50 iterations to converge.
